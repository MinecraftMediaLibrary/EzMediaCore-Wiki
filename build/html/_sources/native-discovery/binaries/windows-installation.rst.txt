Support for Windows (Easy)
==============================================================

Out of all the three main Operating Systems, Windows is probably the easiest. There are only two possible
binaries that you could use for Windows â€” 32 bit and 64 bit. Therefore, I hosted the two zips on Github
as a way for users to download it if they don't have it installed.

`32-bit Version <https://github.com/MinecraftMediaLibrary/VLC-Release-Mirror/tree/master/win32>`_

`64-bit Version <https://github.com/MinecraftMediaLibrary/VLC-Release-Mirror/tree/master/win64>`_

Currently, MinecraftMediaLibrary supports Windows. There are no plans for removing support in the near future.
